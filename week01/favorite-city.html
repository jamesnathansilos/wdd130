<h1>Daly City, CA, USA</h1>
<p>My favorite city is located directly south of San Francisco, California. This is where I spent
    majority of my time as a full-time missionary for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day
    Saints.</p>
<p>Although it is a suburban area, it is my favorite as it has a high concentration of Filipinos in
    a diverse community where I can be immersed in other cultures while feeling at home.</p>
